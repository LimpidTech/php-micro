		<h3>Welcome to PHP-Micro.</h3>

		<p>
			This is a <strong>very</strong> minimal framework
			written in PHP. It exists for the sole purpose of
			providing the functionality needed by almost every
			webapp - and nothing more.
		</p>

		<p>
			It makes use of a consistent class organization
			scheme, alongside any utility classes that the
			developers feel are necessary for most webapps.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are expecting it to do everything and more -
			and you absolutely must use PHP - then you should
			probably look into another framework such as
			<a href="http://kohanaframework.org">KohanaPHP</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>
				Note that the developers of PHP-Micro firmly
				believes large webapps should never be
				developed in the PHP language. The should
				be built in something that scales better
				to a large number requests - which PHP
				is very bad at. There are many
				<a href="http://djangoproject.com">smarter</a>,
				<a href="http://expressjs.com">better</a>,
				and
				<a href="http://sinatrarb.com">simpler</a>
				methods to develop large projects for the web.
